# Hr Employee distribution report

This report was done as a portfolio project by *Sridhar Reddy* to showcase my data analyst skills.

## About the report :-

**Aim** : design and execute an end to end business intelligence solution from scratch to track metrics like number of employees by gender, state, race etc and employee age distribution etc 



## Tasks Performed through the entire business intelligence workflow: :-

1) connecting and shaping the source data, 
2) understanding problem statement and writing sql queries and saving the views in csv files to be imported in power BI for creating visuals
3) designing an interactive report.



All the source CSV files (containing information about transactions, returns, products, customers and territories) were made available in the github repository itself.
